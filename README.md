# Coordinate-System-Transformations

TEMA : Implementation of Coordinate System Transformations

 You can see the graph of the result about the given task in the screenshot. You can also access a detailed report about the assignment in the 003CleanResultReport file.
 
 1-GpsCleanResult.py : It gives a clean output and performs all the steps in the task as stated in the comments, but it does not print the inverse transformation formulas and distance differences on the console. also shows all created points on the graph
 
 ---TheTasks---
 
Transition Between Coordinate Systems:
Two-Dimensional Space: Cartesian and Polar Coordinate Systems

Define the coordinates of several points in the polar coordinate system.
Convert these coordinates to the Cartesian coordinate system.
Perform the reverse conversion from the Cartesian coordinate system to the polar coordinate system.
Verify the correctness of the calculations by ensuring that the initial coordinates match the ones obtained after the reverse conversion.

Three-Dimensional Space: Cartesian and Spherical Coordinate Systems

Define the coordinates of several points in the spherical coordinate system.
Convert these coordinates to the Cartesian coordinate system.
Perform the reverse conversion from the Cartesian coordinate system to the spherical coordinate system.
Verify the correctness of the calculations by ensuring that the initial coordinates match the ones obtained after the reverse conversion.

Distance Calculation in the Spherical Coordinate System:

Compute the distance between points in the spherical coordinate system using two methods:

Cartesian Coordinate System: Use the standard formula for calculating straight-line distance in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces.
Polar Coordinate System: Use the formula for calculating the distance between points in a two-dimensional space.
Spherical Coordinate System: Compute the distance between points using two methods:
Through the volume of the sphere: Use the formula for straight-line distance in three-dimensional space.
Along the surface of the sphere: Use the formula for great-circle distance.

Performance Benchmarks:

Generate an array of coordinate pairs in each coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, spherical).
Compute the distances between these points for each coordinate system.
Measure the computation time for each coordinate system.
Choose an array size that results in minimal variability in benchmarking results between runs (a recommended array size is 10,000 to 100,000 points).
Report Requirements
Describe the process of transitioning between coordinate systems and the results of checking calculation accuracy.
Present benchmarking results in the form of tables or graphs, indicating the time required for distance calculations in each coordinate system.
Draw conclusions regarding the efficiency of using each coordinate system for distance calculations.
Recommendations
Use any programming language or development environment that you are comfortable with (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++).
Pay attention to code optimization for benchmarking to reduce variability in the results.
Evaluation Criteria
The quality and validity of conclusions based on benchmarking results.
The quality of the report presentation.

Note : WE CHOOSE GPScleanResult.py  : Three Python similar processes were carried out for the implementation of the Coordinate System Transformations project, but different results were obtained. Although the scenario contains unique features, it was prepared according to the activities specified for our purpose. We would appreciate it if you could write your daily comments to fully evaluate which script's stated task contains no logical errors.
 
 1-CorrectDisctanResult.py : script makes accurate distance calculations and prints the points that are farthest from each other on the screen, which makes this script attractive.
  
 3-GpsAndGraphCalculation.py : This script allows the graphics to be drawn more beautifully and all transactions can be read on the console, very close to the procedure.
